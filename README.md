## Future Improvements to Analysis

Increase analysis on location by incorporating school districts and local amenities

Consider construction costs to make more concrete improvement recommendations

## Conclusion 

Focus on buying low cost properties: southern half of the county, poor / fair condition, no view

Minimal improvements to condition are incrementally more valuable

Adding a bathroom needs to be considered in the context of total home value
